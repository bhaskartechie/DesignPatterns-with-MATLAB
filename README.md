# DesignPatterns-with-MATLAB
This repository contains MATLAB implementations of design patterns, inspired by the book Refactoring.Guru. The scripts were prepared using ChatGPT and demonstrate practical examples of creational, structural, and behavioral patterns in MATLAB. ðŸš€

# **Design Patterns in MATLAB**

This repository contains implementations of various **design patterns** using **MATLAB**. The goal is to provide clear, practical examples that help developers understand and apply these patterns in MATLAB-based projects.

## **About**
The scripts in this repository have been prepared using:
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt)
- The book **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"** from [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book)

Each design pattern is demonstrated with **MATLAB code**, showing how to implement and apply the pattern effectively.

## **Design Patterns Covered**
This repository includes implementations of:
- **Creational Patterns** (Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Singleton, etc.)
- **Structural Patterns** (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, etc.)
- **Behavioral Patterns** (Strategy, Observer, Command, etc.)

Each pattern is accompanied by:
- A brief explanation of its purpose.
- A MATLAB script implementing the pattern.
- A comparison of the approach **with and without the pattern**.

## **Getting Started**
### **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bhaskartechie/DesignPatterns-with-MATLAB.git
cd DesignPatterns-with-MATLAB
```
### **Run MATLAB Scripts**
Open MATLAB and run the MATLAB live file ```DesignPatterns.mlx``` to see the patterns in action.
